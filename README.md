# IMDB RATINGS ANALYSIS 

Welcome to our project on exploratory data analysis of IMDb ratings. 
IMDb, or Internet Movie Database, is one of the most popular movie rating websites, and its ratings are widely used to evaluate the quality of movies. 
In this notebook, we aim to study the factors that affect the ratings of movies, using exploratory data analysis techniques.

To conduct this analysis, we will be using a dataset of IMDb ratings, which includes information about the ratings, crew members, reviews, regions, and genres of a large number of movies. 
The cleanup of the dataset can be found in cleanup.ipynb and the Data Analysis in MadEda.ipynb.
